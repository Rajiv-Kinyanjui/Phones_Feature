# Phones_Feature

# Remember the days before smartphones when text was entered in our phones using the keypad? If you need a refresher, see this image of a phone keypad:

# Notice the letters on each number. To type a letter, the user needs to press the button on which the letter is printed the number of times that corresponds to its order on the button.

# For example, to type "E", the user needs to press "3" two times. To type "Z", the user needs to press "9" four times. To type "DOG", they need to press "3" one time, "6" three times, and "4" one time. And so on.

# Create a program that allows a user to enter text and then it calculates how many clicks it takes for a user to input the text. Ignore uppercase and special characters.

# For example, if a user inputs "James", the output should be 9 because...

"J": press "5" one time
"A": press "2" one time
"M": press "6" one time
"E": press "3" two times
"S": press "7" four times
Put this all together, and 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 9.
